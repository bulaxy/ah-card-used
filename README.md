2 Hrs Project to get a basic card used counter 


## Retro notes

Looking back at it, after I removed the feature where you can compare between the 2 list, I should have migrated this project as a discord bot. but given I set myself a time limit to complete this project in less than 4hrs,  not gonna complain too much
